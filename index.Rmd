## Where does this data come from?

This data is included with the R 'datasets' package.  The source is
The 'U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of the Census (1977) '
*Statistical Abstract of the United States*.

--- 

## What algorithm was used to predict?

The prediction algorithm was a randomForest included with the caret
Package in R.

---

## Further work needed

Need to do better exploratory data analysis,
establish controls, no controls, and come up with a
causal explanation.

If we do more careful data analysis, it will show that by
investing in policies that lower the illiteracy rate,
we can save lives. Win-Win.
